# New Statistics Graph
A general-purpose graph card for Home Assistant. Plot **any** recorder statistic, short-term 'raw' history, calculated series, and **forecast data** (solar or weather) together on one chart. It reuses the built-in ECharts instance shipped with Home Assistant, so you get native styling with minimal overhead, and it can optionally follow the energy date picker for time range selection.

Unlike the default cards like `energy-usage-graph` or `statistics-graph`, this card is not limited to energy dashboard entities. Any long-term statistic available in the recorder database can be used, as well as the short-term 'raw' history and live forecasts. For aggregated statistics you can choose the type (`change`, `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `state`) for each series separately.  
<br>
It grew out of an energy-focused card, so it integrates tightly with the energy date picker, but nothing about it is energy-specific anymore.

## Key Features

- This card has an full-featured graphical editor, so almost all settings can be done through the UI.
- Displayed timespan sync with the energy date picker (`energy-date-selection`).
- Supports any entity that exposes long-term statistics, as well as the short-term 'raw' history.
- Solar forecast entities that are used in the energy dashboard can also be shown in the charts.
- Weather forecast attributes (temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, …) can be plotted from any `weather.*` entity, fetched live via the same websocket API the native weather-forecast card uses.
- Forecast series show their full now-forward range by default (the x-axis stretches to fit), with an optional `forecast_horizon` to cap how far ahead they reach.
- Allows to compute and display 'live' values for the current running hour before HA provides the final aggregation.
- Uses Home Assistant's bundled ECharts runtime – no extra framework needs to be loaded.
- Override the energy date pickers default aggregation periods, to e.g. display hourly instead of daily bars when viewing a monthly report.
- Per-series control over aggregation type, chart type (bar, line or step), stacking, color, unit, scaling and offsets.
- Optional fill-between-rendering for line series to fill the space e.g. between min / max line-charts
- Optional manual timespan selection (fixed ranges or relative day/week/month/year offsets) when you don't want to use the energy date picker.
- Support for calculated series, so you can e.g. add and subtract sensor values as a computed signal
- Quick access to colors from the HA energy color palette and native styles so mixed dashboards look consistent.
- Maps boolean strings like `on/off`, `true/false` to the numeric values `0/1`

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, open *HACS > Frontend* and click the three-dot menu in the top right.
2. Choose *Custom repositories*, add `https://github.com/Thyraz/energy-custom-graph`, and leave the category set to *Lovelace*.
3. Search for "New Statistics Graph" in HACS, install the latest release.
4. Reload the browser and clear the Browser cache if the card won't show up immediately.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest `energycustomgraph.js` from the repository release or the `dist/` folder.
2. Copy it into your Home Assistant config directory, e.g. `config/www/community/energy-custom-graph/energycustomgraph.js`.
3. Add the resource to Lovelace (Settings → Dashboards → Resources → **+ ADD RESOURCE**):
   - URL: `/local/community/energy-custom-graph/energycustomgraph.js`
   - Resource type: `JavaScript Module`
4. Clear your browser cache and Reload the page.

## Usage

Add the card to a dashboard using the graphical card editor or via YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Custom energy overview
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_grid_import
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_grid_export
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: line
    fill: true
```

The card supports the energy date picker for timespan selection. Set `timespan.mode: "energy"` (which is the default) and place an `energy-date-selection` control on the same dashboard. For other timespan modes, see the `timespan` configuration below.

## Configuration

By default the card mirrors the core energy cards and automatically selects the recorder statistics period (5-minute, hourly, daily, or monthly) based on the chosen timespan. You can override this behaviour via the `aggregation` options described below.  


### Generic card options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `type` | string | – | Must be `custom:new-statistics-graph`. |
| `title` | string | – | Optional card header. |
| `chart_height` | string | – | CSS height (e.g. `300px`). Ignored when the card is used inside a section layout (the grid rows control the height). |
| `timespan` | object | `{mode: "energy"}` | Controls the time range displayed (see below). |
| `forecast_horizon` | string | – | Optional cap on how far forward forecast data is shown/fetched, measured from the period end (e.g. `48h`, `7d`). When unset, the full forecast the entity provides is shown and the x-axis stretches to fit it. See the note under Timespan options. |
| `collection_key` | string | – | Custom key when multiple energy date pickers are present (only for `timespan.mode: "energy"`). <br>[More Info](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/energy/#using-multiple-collections) |
| `allow_compare` | boolean | `true` | For energy date picker mode: Respects the compare toggle when `true`. Set to `false` to disable this behavior. |
| `hide_legend` | boolean | `false` | Hide the legend entirely. |
| `legend_sort` | `"asc"`, `"desc"`, `"none"` | `"none"` | Sort order for the legend entries. |
| `expand_legend` | boolean | `false` | Expand the legend by default. |
| `tooltip_precision` | number | – | Override numeric precision in the tooltip. |
| `show_unit` | boolean | `true` | Show corresponding units from the recorder database when available in tooltips and axes. |
| `show_stack_sums` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, adds positive/negative totals for each visible stack to the tooltip. |
| `y_axes` | list | – | Y axis configuration for both left and right axes (see below). |
| `aggregation` | object | auto | Control recorder aggregation intervals. See below. |
| `series` | list | – | One or more series definitions (see below). |

### Timespan options

The `timespan` configuration controls the time range displayed by the card. Currently three modes are supported::

**Mode: `energy` (default)**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: energy
```
Use a energy date picker on the same dashboard. The card automatically follows the selected range.

**Mode: `relative`**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: relative
  period: day        # hour, day, week, month, year, last_60_minutes, last_24_hours, last_7_days, last_30_days, or last_12_months
  offset: -1         # Optional offset (e.g., -1 for yesterday/previous period)
```
Displays a relative time period. The card supports two types, inspired by the options in the energy date picker:

***Calendar-based periods*** (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`):
- "day" would e.g. mean today from 00:00 to 23:59 as base date
- `offset` shifts by the complete period (hours for `hour`, days for `day`, ... )

***Rolling window periods*** (`last_60_minutes`, `last_24_hours`, `last_7_days`, `last_30_days`, `last_12_months`):
- End date is "now"
- `offset` shifts by hours for `last_60_minutes`, days for `last_24_hours`/`last_7_days`/`last_30_days`, months for `last_12_months`.

**Mode: `fixed`**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: fixed
  start: "2024-01-01T00:00:00"   # Optional, defaults to start of today
  end: "2024-01-31T23:59:59"     # Optional, defaults to end of start day
```
Display a fixed time range. Dates use ISO 8601 format. If omitted, `start` defaults to the beginning of today and `end` defaults to the end of the start day.

**Forecast horizon**

Forecast series (`source: forecast` and `source: weather_forecast`) are always now-forward — they only ever contain data from the current moment onwards, so a picker window entirely in the past renders no forecast at all.

By default the card shows the **full** forecast the entity provides and automatically stretches the x-axis past the selected period end to fit it, while the picker still governs the historic window. Set the top-level `forecast_horizon` (e.g. `48h`, `7d`) to **cap** how far forward the forecast is shown and fetched — measured from the period end. Supported units: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`. Use it when a multi-day forecast would otherwise stretch the axis further than you want.

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
forecast_horizon: 48h   # optional cap; omit to show the entity's full forecast
series:
  - source: weather_forecast
    weather_entity: weather.home
    attribute: temperature
    chart_type: line
```

### `series` options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name` | string | entity name | Display name shown in tooltip and legend. |
| `source` | `"statistic"`, `"calculation"`, `"forecast"`, `"weather_forecast"` | inferred | Data source type. When omitted the card can auto-detect the source based on the other fields for `statistic` and `calculation` signals. Use `forecast` to plot solar forecasts configured in the Energy dashboard, or `weather_forecast` to plot a forecast attribute from a `weather.*` entity. |
| `statistic_id` | string | – | Entity with long term statistics (e.g. `sensor.entity_id`). Required unless series uses a `calculation` instead. |
| `stat_type` | `"change"`, `"sum"`, `"mean"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"state"` | `"change"` | Statistic type to display for this entity. Not used when `calculation` is provided, as each subseries has it's own setting there. |
| `calculation` | object | – | Build a computed series from multiple statistics / terms (see below). |
| `chart_type` | `"bar"`, `"line"`, `"step"` | `"bar"` | Chart type. |
| `stack` | string | – | Stack key for combining series. Series with identical keys will get stacked on top of each other. |
| `y_axis` | `"left"`, `"right"` | `"left"` | Axis assignment. |
| `show_in_legend` | boolean | `true` | Whether to display this series in the legend. If `false`, the series remains visible in the chart but has no legend entry. |
| `show_in_tooltip` | boolean | `true` | Controls whether the series appears in the tooltip. Set to `false` to keep the graph visible while hiding numbers from the hover tooltip. |
| `hidden_by_default` | boolean | `false` | Whether the series is initially hidden when the chart loads. The series can still be toggled via the legend. |
| `color` | string | next in palette | Specific color (supports `#rrggbb`, `rgb()` or CSS variables). |
| `compare_color` | string | inherit | Optional color for compare series. Defaults to the base series color with reduced opacity. |
| `line_opacity` | number | style default | Override stroke opacity (0–1). Defaults to 0.85 for line charts and 1.0 for bar outlines. |
| `line_width` | number | `1.5` | Line thickness in pixels (line charts only). |
| `line_style` | `"solid"`, `"dashed"`, `"dotted"` | `"solid"` | Line pattern style (line charts only). |
| `fill` | boolean | `false` | Fill the area underneath the line. |
| `fill_opacity` | number | style default | Override fill opacity (0–1). Defaults to 0.15 for line charts and 0.5 for bars. |
| `fill_to_series` | string | – | For line charts only: name of another line series to fill towards. Both series must not be stacked. |
| `smooth` | boolean or number | `true` | Line smoothing. Use `false` to disable and true for the default HA behavior. Or provide a value between 0 and 1 for finer control. |
| `multiply` | number | `1` | Apply a multiplier to each series value. |
| `add` | number | `0` | Apply an additive offset after multiplication. |
| `clip_min` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are smaller. |
| `clip_max` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are larger. |
| `pv_production_entity` | string | – | (`source: forecast` only) Sensor entity you configured as PV production in the Energy dashboard. Leave unset to sum all configured forecasts. |
| `weather_entity` | string | – | (`source: weather_forecast` only) A `weather.*` entity to fetch the forecast from. Required. |
| `forecast_type` | `"hourly"`, `"daily"`, `"twice_daily"` | `"hourly"` | (`source: weather_forecast` only) Which forecast the entity should provide. Must be supported by the weather integration. |
| `attribute` | string | – | (`source: weather_forecast` only) Forecast field to plot, e.g. `temperature`, `templow`, `precipitation`, `wind_speed`, `humidity`, `pressure`. Required. |

#### Calculated series

Configure `calculation` instead of `statistic_id` to compute a series from multiple entity statistics. Terms are processed sequentially, starting with the `initial_value` (default `0`).

> **RAW data behaviour:** When you combine raw history series, the card reuses the most recent available value for each term at the evaluated timestamp. This “last-known value” fallback keeps calculations stable even if sensors don’t report at identical times.
>
> **Constant-only calculations:** If every term is a constant, the card creates simulated points across the visible time range. That makes it easy to draw horizontal reference lines or to use as a baseline for filling signals stacked on top.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `terms` | list | – | Ordered list of calculation steps. |
| `initial_value` | number | `0` | Start value before the first term. |
| `unit` | string | inferred | Unit for the resulting series (inferring looks for the first statistic used). |

Each term accepts the following options:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `operation` | `"add"`, `"subtract"`, `"multiply"`, `"divide"` | `"add"` | Operation applied in this step of the calculation. |
| `constant` | number | – | Constant number to use in this term. Use alternatively to providing a `statistic_id`. All keys below in this section are ignored in this case. |
| `statistic_id` | string | – | Entity with long term statistics (e.g. `sensor.entity_id`). Do not use in combination with setting `constant` in the same term. |
| `stat_type` | `"change"`, `"sum"`, `"mean"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"state"` | inherit | Statistic type to display for this entity. |
| `multiply` | number | `1` | Apply a multiplier to each series value. |
| `add` | number | `0` | Apply an additive offset after multiplication. |
| `clip_min` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are smaller. |
| `clip_max` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are larger. |

#### Solar forecast series

Set `source: forecast` on a series to render a solar forecasts used in the  Home Assistant energy dashboard settings. Only these are accessable through the websocket API.  
Requirements:

- In *Settings → Dashboards → Energy* you must assign at least one solar forecast integration in a PV production entry.
- Forecast data is retrieved via the `energy/solar_forecast` WebSocket API. The card always works in kWh. Convert using `multiply`/`add` if you need another unit.
- Optional `pv_production_entity` limits the series to the forecasts assigned to this PV production sensor entity in the energy dashboard settings. When omitted, the card sums all available forecasts.

Example:

```yaml
series:
  - source: forecast
    pv_production_entity: sensor.rooftop_pv_energy
    chart_type: line
    name: PV forecast
```

All display options (colors, stacking, smoothing, etc.) work exactly like for statistic-based series.

#### Weather forecast series

Set `source: weather_forecast` on a series to plot a forecast attribute from any `weather.*` entity. The data is fetched live via the stable `weather/subscribe_forecast` websocket command — the same mechanism the native weather-forecast card uses — so no extra configuration is needed beyond picking the entity, forecast type, and attribute.

- `weather_entity` (required): the `weather.*` entity to subscribe to.
- `forecast_type` (default `hourly`): `hourly`, `daily`, or `twice_daily`. The entity must support the chosen type.
- `attribute` (required): the forecast field to plot, e.g. `temperature`, `templow`, `precipitation`, `wind_speed`, `humidity`, `pressure`. Plot one attribute per series — add another series for another attribute.

Notes:

- Forecasts are **now-forward** only: points before the current time are dropped, so a picker window entirely in the past shows nothing. The full forecast is shown by default (the x-axis stretches past the period end to fit it); use `forecast_horizon` to cap how far ahead it reaches (see Timespan options).
- The card derives the unit from the weather entity's `*_unit` attributes when possible (temperature, precipitation, wind, pressure, visibility) and uses `%` for humidity/cloud coverage. Override it per axis with `y_axes[].unit` if needed.
- All display options (color, `chart_type`, `line_style`, `fill`, `smooth`, `y_axis`, `multiply`, `add`, …) work exactly like for statistic-based series.

Example:

```yaml
series:
  - source: weather_forecast
    weather_entity: weather.home
    forecast_type: hourly
    attribute: temperature
    chart_type: line
    name: Forecast temperature
    y_axis: right
```

#### Fill between line series

Set `fill_to_series` on a line series to fill the area between this and the targeted line. The value must match the `name` of the target series. Requirements:

- Both series must be rendered as lines (no bars) and must not use stacking.
- The referenced `name` has to be unique within the card configuration.
- When the upper series drops below the lower one, the card sets the fill to zero and logs a warning.
- The fill_opacity used is the one configured on the upper series (or the default if unspecified).

### `y_axes` options

Configure both left and right Y axes individually. The right axis appears automatically when a series uses `y_axis: right` or when an explicit `right` axis configuration exists.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | `"left"`, `"right"` | – | Axis selector to override (`left` is primary). |
| `min` | number | auto | Minimum axis value. **Note:** Ignored when `center_zero` is active. |
| `max` | number | auto | Maximum axis value. When `center_zero` is active, this value is used for both positive and negative bounds (e.g., `max: 10` creates range -10 to +10). |
| `fit_y_data` | boolean | `false` | Force this axis to fit its data range tightly. |
| `center_zero` | boolean | `false` | Center the axis around zero by making min/max symmetric (e.g., -10 to +10). Useful for visualizing values from different y-axes with zero aligned. If `max` is not set, it will be calculated from the data. |
| `logarithmic_scale` | boolean | `false` | Apply logarithmic scaling to this axis. |
| `unit` | string | metadata | Override unit label for this axis. |

### Aggregation options

Possibility to override the aggregation interval. By default, the card mirrors HA’s energy cards (hours for daily, days for weekly/monthly, months for yearly ranges).

```yaml
aggregation:
  manual: hour          # Used when the card is not linked to the energy date picker
  fallback: day         # Used if the preferred aggregation returns no data
  energy_picker:
    day: 5minute
    week: hour
    month: day
    year: month
```

- `manual` applies when the timespan mode is `relative` or `fixed` (energy date picker not used).
- `energy_picker` sets the aggregation used when the energy date picker selects `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, or `year` ranges. Any range not listed keeps the default value.
- `fallback` Optional. Is used if the preferred interval returns no data.
- Valid intervals: `"5minute"`, `"hour"`, `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, `"raw"`, `"disabled"`.
- Use `"raw"` to fetch recorder history states without aggregation. Use `"disabled"` to skip the request entirely and show a “choose a shorter period” message instead.
- `compute_current_hour` (boolean) creates a live estimate for the ongoing hour by combining the most recent 5 minute statistics until Home Assistant publishes the official hourly aggregate.

> **Heads up:** Enabling `compute_current_hour` issues an extra 5 minute statistics query every few minutes while the current hour is visible. This increases database load slightly, so only enable it when you need near real-time hourly numbers.

> **Autoamtic raw data mapping:** When you use RAW history, boolean-like strings (`on/off`, `open/closed`, `true/false`) are automatically mapped to the numbers `1/0` so binary sensors can be rendered as numeric lines.

Tip: use fine intervals only for short ranges to avoid excessive resource usage and loading times.

## Examples

### 1. Manual fixed window with dual axes

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Heating performance snapshot
timespan:
  mode: fixed
  start: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
  end: 2024-01-08T00:00:00Z

    chart_type: bar
  - statistic_id: sensor.outdoor_temperature
    name: Outdoor temperature
    stat_type: mean
    chart_type: line
    y_axis: right
```

### 1a. Centered zero axis for grid import/export comparison

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Grid power balance
y_axes:
  - id: left
    unit: kW
    center_zero: true
    max: 5  # Optional: forces range to -5 to +5, otherwise auto-calculated
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.grid_import
    name: Import
    stat_type: mean
    chart_type: line
  - statistic_id: sensor.grid_export
    name: Export
    stat_type: mean
    chart_type: line
    multiply: -1
```

### 2. Shift the period for a previous year view

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Solar production (last year)
timespan:
  mode: relative
  period: year
  offset: -1
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.solar_total_energy
    name: Solar production
    stat_type: change
```

### 2a. Rolling window for last 30 days

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Energy consumption (last 30 days)
timespan:
  mode: relative
  period: last_30_days
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.home_energy_consumption
    name: Consumption
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: bar
```

### 3. Fill the range between minimum and maximum

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Outdoor temperature band
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.outdoor_temperature
    name: Max temperature
    stat_type: max
    chart_type: line
    fill_to_series: Min temperature
  - statistic_id: sensor.outdoor_temperature
    name: Min temperature
    stat_type: min
    chart_type: line
```

### 4. Recreate the energy dashboard usage card

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
hide_legend: true
series:
  - name: Solar self consumed
    chart_type: bar
    color: "--energy-solar-color"
    stack: energy
    clip_min: 0   # self-consumption should never get negative. Clip in case the value should be zero and gets a little bit negative due to rounding errors
    calculation:  # self-consumption is: total pv production - export to grid - battery charge
      unit: kWh
      terms:
        - statistic_id: sensor.total_solar_production
          operation: add
        - statistic_id: sensor.total_grid_export
          operation: subtract
        - statistic_id: sensor.total_battery_charge
          operation: subtract
  - statistic_id: sensor.total_grid_import
    name: Imported
    chart_type: bar
    color: "--energy-grid-consumption-color"
    stack: energy
  - statistic_id: sensor.total_battery_discharge
    name: Battery discharge
    chart_type: bar
    color: "--energy-battery-out-color"
    stack: energy
  - statistic_id: sensor.total_grid_export
    name: Exported
    chart_type: bar
    multiply: -1
    color: "--energy-grid-return-color"
    stack: energy
  - statistic_id: sensor.total_battery_charge
    name: Battery charge
    chart_type: bar
    multiply: -1
    color: "--energy-battery-in-color"
    stack: energy
```

### 5. Binary sensor with short ranges in RAW and disabled long ranges

This setup draws a step line for a binary sensor. RAW history is used for the shortest two picker ranges, while longer ranges disable fetching and prompt the user to select a shorter period.

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Garage door activity
series:
  - statistic_id: binary_sensor.garage_door
    name: Garage door
    stat_type: state
    chart_type: step
    smooth: false
aggregation:
  energy_picker:
    hour: raw
    day: raw
    week: disabled
    month: disabled
    year: disabled
```

### 6. Hourly consumption with live current hour

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Consumption
aggregation:
  energy_picker:
    hour: hour
    day: day
  compute_current_hour: true
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_import
    name: Import
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: bar
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_solar
    name: Solar
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: bar
```

With `compute_current_hour` enabled the card keeps the current hour up to date using 5 minute statistics, while historical hours continue to come from Home Assistant’s long-term database.

### 7. Measured temperature vs. weather forecast

Plot a measured sensor as a solid line on the left axis and a weather forecast attribute as a dashed line on the right axis. `forecast_horizon` extends the chart 48 hours past the selected period so the upcoming forecast stays visible.

```yaml
type: custom:new-statistics-graph
title: Temperature vs. forecast
forecast_horizon: 48h
y_axes:
  - id: left
    unit: °C
  - id: right
    unit: °C
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
    name: Measured
    stat_type: mean
    chart_type: line
    line_style: solid
    y_axis: left
  - source: weather_forecast
    weather_entity: weather.home
    forecast_type: hourly
    attribute: temperature

## Tips

- Ensure recorder and long-term statistics are enabled for every entity you plan to use.
- Use the relative period mode with positive or negative offsets to jump by whole days, weeks, months, or years.
- When using `fill_to_series`, keep `name` values unique and avoid stacking for the involved series.
- When using multiple energy date pickers on a single dashboard, provide the appropriate `collection_key` so the card links to the correct selection.
- Combine `multiply` and `add` to convert units (e.g. Wh to kWh) without the need for extra template sensors.
